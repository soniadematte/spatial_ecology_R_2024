## 1. INTRODUCTION
# It is known that Sicily is one of the most dry and with extreme hot temperature italian regions, 
# and every year the situation is aggravating. I decided to study a specific region of Sicily,
# which is Parco delle Madonie, a naturalistic protected park.

## 2. HYPOTESIS
# Specifically, I wanted to see if the is a correlation between the increase of temperature and decrease
# of precipitation with the decrease of vegetation.

## 5. CREATION OF DATAFRAME WITH TEMPERATURES AND PRECIPITATION  OF 2010-2015-2020-2024 SUMMER

# Creation of dataframe: temperature and precipitation in Sicily for each year analysed (2010, 2015, 2020, 2025)
# To create a dataframe I use can not use the package meteostat because is too old for R and Rstudio, so I have to download them manually
# I download the data of temperature and precipitation for the period 01/06 - 31/08 of each year in Parco delle Madonie, located in Petralia Sottana
# from the website of meteostat.

# I upload the data of the meteo station from my file of each year
meteo2010 <- read_csv("C:/SpatialEcology_Progetto/ParcoMadonie_2010.csv")

# I check the columns
head(meteo2010)

meteo2015<- read_csv("C:/SpatialEcology_Progetto/ParcoMadonie_2015.csv")
head(meteo2015)

meteo2020<- read_csv("C:/SpatialEcology_Progetto/ParcoMadonie_2020.csv")
head(meteo2020)

# I make sure that the date are under the format date
meteo_all$date <- as.Date(meteo_all$date)

# I extract the year
meteo_all$year <- format(meteo_all$date, "%Y")

# I calculate the mean of temperature and precipitation for each year
meteo_summary <- meteo_all %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(
    average_temperature = mean(tavg, na.rm = TRUE),

# I print the result, I will need the information later to do the graphs to 
# visualize the trend of precipitation and temperatures
print(meteo_summary)


# 6. DOWNLOAD AND VISUALIZATION OF EACH MEAN NDVI OF EVERY SUMMER
# to download the images of the park for 2010, 2015, 2020, 2024 I have to use appEEARS, another 
# NASA website with geodata, beacuse even though is not extreme good quality (use of MODIS, which has a
# resolution of one pixel per 250 m^2) it is better for me to use 
# because there is no data of the years 2010 and 2015 with Sentinel-2, so I use always the same kind of 
# map to be more coherent and scientific. 

# For the year 2010 I downloaded the images from 1/06/2010 to 31/08/2010 in .tiff format, with NDVI included
# then I made the mean of the NDVI to get just one image to see

# I decided to use these colors - blue, grey, green - to have an higher visible impact on the plot
# so I created the function with the new palette
palette_ndvi <- colorRampPalette(c("#313695", "#f7f7f7", "#006837"))

                                        ## This creates a smooth transition for the NDVI map

# 8. CORRELATION BETWEEN TOTAL PRECIPITATION AND AVERAGE TEMPERATURE WITH NDVI
# Then I create a dataframe with all my data to compare vegetation, precipitation and temperature between all four years

# I find the mean NDVI of each year with the function global of the package terra
# The global() function calculates summary statistics (e.g., mean, min, max)
# for the entire raster layer. It is used to extract a single value that 
# represents the whole dataset, such as the average NDVI of a given year.
# it is different from ndvi_mean, which is a raster and not a number, where every pixel has a NDVI value

ndvi_2010_val <- global(ndvi_mean2010, fun = mean, na.rm = TRUE)[[1]] # 'na.rm = TRUE' it is used to remove
                                                                      # the missing values (NA) of those pixel

## CALCULATION OF 2024 NDVI FROM SENTINEL-2
# Now I want to calculate the NDVI with a image taken with sentinel-2 on Copernicus Browser, which is more accurate 
# This is necessary to see if the MODIS NDVI is really rapresentative of the vegetation, to verify that 
# MODIS has valid data

library(terra)

# I upload the raster (B04) - the red band is telling me how much red light the plants are absorbing (and 
# using for photosynteshis), so if I have a low value of B04, it means that plants are absorbing a lot 
# of light and are alive and healthy

b04 <- rast("B04.tiff")

# I upload the .shp file (Using the percorso I have saved it in)
parco <- vect("C:/SpatialEcology_Progetto/ParcoMadonie/ParcoMadonie.shp")

# I cut the raster in the extension of the park, to be more precise
b04 <- rast("C:/SpatialEcology_Progetto/B04.tiff")

# Crop + mask
b04_crop <- crop(b04, parco)
b04_masked <- mask(b04_crop, parco)

library(viridis)

plot(b04_masked,
     col = viridis(100, option = "plasma"),
     main = "B04 - Clipped to Parco delle Madonie",
     zlim = c(0, max(values(b04_masked), na.rm = TRUE))

# I upload the raster b08 - the NIR (NearInfraRed) is the invisible to human eye light that plants reflect
# B08 has high value when plants reflect more, and it means that they are alive and not stressed
b08 <- rast("C:/SpatialEcology_Progetto/B08.tiff")

# I cut B08 on the park extension too
b08_crop <- crop(b08, parco)
b08_masked <- mask(b08_crop, parco)

# Now I can calculate the NDVI Sentinel-2
# to get the NDVI I have to:
ndvi_s2_2024 <- (b08_masked - b04_masked) / (b08_masked + b04_masked)


## 10. CONSISTENCY BETWEEN MODIS AND SENTINEL-2 MODIS
# I recall the library I need
library(terra)
library(ggplot2)

# I reproject the Sentinel-2 NDVI raster to match the coordinate reference system of the MODIS NDVI raster.
# This ensures spatial alignment between the two datasets. Bilinear interpolation is used for continuous data.

ndvi_s2_projected <- project(ndvi_s2_2024, ndvi_mean2024, method = "bilinear")

# I resample the Sentinel NDVI raster to match the resolution and extent of the MODIS NDVI raster.
# This is necessary to allow pixel-by-pixel comparison between the two datasets.

ndvi_s2_resampled <- resample(ndvi_s2_projected, ndvi_mean2024)

# I extract the pixel values from both the MODIS and resampled Sentinel-2 NDVI rasters
ndvi_compare <- cbind(values(ndvi_mean2024), values(ndvi_s2_resampled))

# I convert the combined pixel values into a data frame for easier manipulation and plotting
ndvi_df <- as.data.frame(ndvi_compare)

# I assign appropriate column names to the data frame
colnames(ndvi_df) <- c("NDVI_MODIS", "NDVI_SENTINEL")

# I remove any rows containing NA values to ensure accurate analysis
ndvi_df <- na.omit(ndvi_df)

# Now I cane create a plot where I can visualize if the rappresentation accurate

library(ggplot2)
ggplot(ndvi_df, aes(x = NDVI_MODIS, y = NDVI_SENTINEL)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3, color = "darkviolet") +
  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0, linetype = "dashed") +
  labs(
    title = "NDVI MODIS vs Sentinel-2 – Summer 2024",
    x = "NDVI MODIS (2024)",
    y = "NDVI Sentinel-2 (2024)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

## 11. CALCULATION OF COEFFICIENT OF DETERMINATION
# To understan if the sentinel-2 data can be explained well with MODIS, I calculate the 
# coefficient of determination R^2, where if R^2 > 0.8 it means that the two sensor are
# coherent to measure vegetation

# I calculate the regression 
mod <- lm(NDVI_SENTINEL ~ NDVI_MODIS, data = ndvi_df)

# I calculate R^2
r2 <- summary(mod)$r.squared
print(paste("R-squared:", round(r2, 3)))


## 12. PREDICTION NDVI MAP FOR 2030
# Now I want to do a prediction of NDVI based on the previously years, assuming that it is a constat 
# and linear variation. In this way I'm doing a raster, resulting in a map of 2030 NDVI where I have 
# the spatial variation of NDVI for each pixel

# Linear model
ndvi_model <- lm(mean_ndvi ~ year, data = complete_data)

# Prevision for 2030
predicted_ndvi <- predict(ndvi_model, newdata = data.frame(year = 2030))
print(predicted_ndvi)

# NDVI trend: mean variation every 14 years
ndvi_diff <- ndvi_mean2024 - ndvi_mean2010   # Both the ndvi are raster, I'm getting the difference 
                                             # between the two images pixel per pixel
ndvi_trend <- ndvi_diff / 14  # mean yearly variation for each pixel

# I project it to the year 2030 (so i multiply the mean NDVI of each pixel x 6 and add the the 2024 ndvi) 
ndvi_2030 <- ndvi_mean2024 + ndvi_trend * 6

# I visualise it in a map
plot(ndvi_2030,
     col = palette_ndvi(100),
     main = "Estimated NDVI - Summer 2030"
)

## 13. STATISTIC NDVI VALUE PREDICTION FOR 2030
# Now I do a statistic linear regression to understand how NDVI will be in 2030, 
# which will be even more statistical significative

# I create a dataframe with the information of every NDVI of each year, which I'm going to use 
# to understend the trend in the years
ndvi_years <- data.frame(
  year = c(2010, 2015, 2020, 2024),
  mean_ndvi = c(0.5631159, 0.5792164, 0.5631159, 0.5273455)
)

# I do a linear regression to calculate the NDVI in the year 2030, this is done by understanding
# the correlation between year and mean NDVI
model <- lm(mean_ndvi ~ year, data = ndvi_years)

# Assuming that the trend is linear, I predict NDVI for 2030
predicted_2030 <- predict(model, newdata = data.frame(year = 2030))

# Add 2030 prediction to the dataframe for plotting
ndvi_years <- rbind(ndvi_years, data.frame(year = 2030, mean_ndvi = predicted_2030))

# Plot
ggplot(ndvi_years, aes(x = year, y = mean_ndvi)) +
  geom_line(color = "#1b9e77", size = 1.2) +
  geom_point(color = "#1b9e77", size = 3) +
  ylim(0.50, 0.60) +    # I know that my NDVI are in a range between 0.50 and 0.60, so a put this limit on the y aes
  labs(
    title = "Mean Summer NDVI Trend (2010–2030)",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Mean NDVI") +
  theme_minimal()


#### 14. CONCLUSIONS ####

# Variation of temperature and precipitation are correlated to the variation of vegetation, meaning that
# when there is a higher temperature and lower precipitation there is less vegetation too

# Due to the increase of extreme variables the vegetation is decreasing, the previosion for 2030
# shows a lower NDVI if it follows a linear trend
